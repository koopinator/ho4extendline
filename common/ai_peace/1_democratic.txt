#Alright, I don't think the original democratic ai really works for the great war. It causes the AI to favour government change far too much. Democratic nations have annexed territory of defeated nations, You know? Alsace, Eupen are some i think about. I'm going to let democratic nations use neutral AI from now on, Maybe that will make it annex claimed territory, like any SENSICAL nation would do. Fucking hell man. - It pisses me off whenever i see a nation defeat another major nation, Only to see shit like 'France took 2 states, A democratic government was up' when thats fucking idiotic. This system is made for the USA right? Does Paradox think that the USA is some altruistic harbinger of justice? Yeah, The USA would NEVER have colonies. They would NEVER occupy foreign territory. They would NEVER collaborate with fascist regimes like franco's. No, The USA is the SAVIOUR of mankind. the leader of the free would and all that shit.
#For the record, I don't hate the US. My country (the netherlands) would probably have been a soviet sattelite had it not been for D-Day. But this glorification of the USA as fighting for our freedom - that is so clearly represented in the democratic peace AI - is unacceptable.
